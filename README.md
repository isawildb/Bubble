# Datavis Exercise

1. Download the files from this repository.
2. Open index.html in a web Browser.
3. Make changes to data.js to create a unique visualization.

## Hints

* To change a file, simply open it in a text editor and edit it. There are default text editors but you might want to use something like [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3), [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) which are built especially for developers.
* The data format used in JavaScript is [JSON](https://www.wikiwand.com/de/JavaScript_Object_Notation).
* You can't break anything!
